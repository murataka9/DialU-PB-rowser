###This is joke app. 
***
#### This App simulate IE5 for MacOS9 on iOS
- When you see website, you must listen to DialUp Sound and wait 26sec.
- The difference this app and the safari is　 " looks only "　 .
- This app desiged ClassicDesign.
- I recommend that you turn off the silence mode.
- The WebView is standard WebView of iOS, so it can read HTML5 and CSS3.
- This app support Japanese only. I will support others Languages at future updates...maybe......

###Have a nice your nostalgic time.
